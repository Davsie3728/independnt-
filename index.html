<h2>Registered Nursing </h2>
<h3>Why? </h3>
<p>I would love to become a registered nurse because there are so many jobs I could choose from. I could work with anyone, from newborns to the elderly. Because a registered nurse must be knowledgeable of the entire body and it's system. There are many fields I could choose from depending on what sparks my interest the most. Anywhere from a physician's office to the hospital. Helping others is a feeling of accomplishment that I can not describe, and to be able to do that on a regular basis would mean a lot whether it's helping care for a child at birth or making the last few days of someone's life comfortable. Not only would I help someone, I would be creating a relationship with my community. </p>
<h3>What do I need? </h3>
<p>A degree of at the minimum Associates, or you could get your Bachelors degree. After you graduate and pass all of your needed classes you have to then pass a state nursing exam. Once you do those things you are then certified as a registered nurse. </p>
<h3>Jobs I can get? </h3>
<p>Well after you pass your certification exam and get your degree, you are qualified for any nursing job. As I said in my 'Why?' section, there is a wide range of options. You can work with newborns that have just been brought into this world to making someones last few days on the earth comfortable when they say goodbye. From a Hospital to a Office. You like a fast pace? Go look into the ER. You like a slower pace? There's many doctor offices around. Want to work with kids or elderly? Go to a children hospital or a pediatric office, or go to a retirement home. </p>
<p>While I was doing my research I found a Job opening at 'ATC Healthcare'. It's an RN opening, there's are the following benefits and requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting wage ( Hourly or yearly) <br>
  $35</li>
  <li>nition programs, daily pay, flexible schedules, medical plan, dental/vision plan, flexible spending accounts, health care reimbursement account, dependent care reimbursement account, tuition reimbursement, 104k savings plan with company matching contribution, discount program for health care work apparel. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Average Starting Salary?</h3>
<p>Ranged to about $68,450 dollars a year, starting out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outside Life</h2>
<h3>Where would you like to live? </h3>
<p>When I get older my best-friend and I have always talked about moving in together. So in my late teens, early 20's I would love to have that experience and live with her. I would think we could get a small house in a nice area like Johns Island, or maybe even Summer ville. I've heard the places down there are relatively cheaper. As I start to get older I want to start to move into a more stable home. One that can support a family and all of that. That will come once I start to get into a serious relationship with my future husband. </p>
<h3>Marriage? Kids? </h3>
<p>I do want to get married, but that's not something I can just push. I have to let all of that fall into place. I hope one day I will find my soul mate. Once I do find that one person I want to spend the rest of my life with, I want to have two kids. A boy and A girl, but if it's two girl or two boys don't get me wrong I'll love them to death no matter what. Once an average it's about $200,000 dollars to raise one child to 21. For two it's going to be about $400,000, I better start saving now. </p>
<h3>Transportation? </h3>
<p>As I'm about to be able to start driving myself around pretty soon, I've always wanted a truck. But not just any truck, I want the real deal. My dream truck would be Chevy Silverer, four door or at least extended cab. Jacked up with a 4 inch lift with 35&quot; mud boggers on it. A white one, so once I go get into the mud it'll be pretty. I'm sure you think that kind of funny coming from a girl, but once I get my dream truck I'll have all these boys looking my it. I will work to get this truck so I can have it when I'm older. With the four door, I would be able to fit my whole family in there, I could fit them into an extended cab also. As I become a mother I might switch over to a SUV, but it's going on big tires. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In the end... </h2>
<p>In the end I'll be able to get what I want done. As I'm going to college I'll have a job to help me out. I'll  use some of my check for bills and the necessary things I need, then put the rest up. Once I get out of college I'll start working and have that saved up money that I'll just be adding too. So I could pay for my college debt, and have backup money for when I need it. </p>
<h1>These are my goals. </h1>
